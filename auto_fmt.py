"""Chat rendering for any model whose template transformers can render.

Same contract as ``nemotron_fmt``: ``render()`` turns a pool dialogue record into
the exact byte string the model sees at inference.

This is ``nemotron_fmt`` with the model path unpinned. That module was already
not a hand port: it drives the model's own ``chat_template.jinja`` through
``transformers.apply_chat_template``, which is the reference implementation, so
byte equality is true by construction rather than by assertion. Nothing in it
was specific to Nemotron except the name of one environment variable, so this
file generalises that and removes the need for a new renderer per model.

Point it at the original weights::

    export FOUNDRY_MODEL_DIR=/src

Reproducibility. If the template calls ``strftime_now``, an unpinned build
depends on the day it ran, and two builds a week apart differ. Set::

    export FOUNDRY_PIN_DATE=2026-08-14

and that call is frozen. If the template needs a date and none is pinned, this
module refuses to render rather than quietly emit a corpus nobody can rebuild.

Register it once in ``build.py``::

    FORMATTERS = {
        "glimmer":  "glimmer_fmt",
        "nemotron": "nemotron_fmt",
        "auto":     "auto_fmt",
    }

and then every new model is ``chat.format: auto`` in its recipe, with no new
code at all.
